						<h2>General study skills</h2>
						<p> When we start our studies, all of us already have different kinds of study skills. Our motivation springs from different sources, as does our general attitude to our studies. Nevertheless, regardless of where we are coming from, we need to take many things into consideration in our studies. Study success requires clear objectives, motivation, planning, self-discipline, self-confidence, good study habits and a positive attitude. Being physically fit is also helpful.
							</p>
								<span>Following are some study tips:</span>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Deep orientation:</span> It involves a genuine motivation to understand what is studied. Students who adopt this orientation have an easier time learning both the detail and the big picture because the topics studied are placed in a meaningful context. A deep orientation fosters interest in conclusions and how they are made. Motivation is driven more by an interest in the topic, and less by performance as such. Exam answers describe, assess and are critical. In addition, the student shows that he or she has understood the big picture and may illuminate upon this by means of examples. Students that have a deep orientation generally also enjoy their studies.</li>
										<li> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Information retrieval:</span> Independent information retrieval as well as its processing and critical evaluation are an integral part of your studies. It is important that you learn to identify when and what kind of information is needed, as well as from where to seek this information. An information literate student will consider that information retrieval and utilisation skills are a fundamental aspect of his or her expertise also after graduation. Haaga-Helia’s library and information services actively promote the information literacy of students. They offer students both printed and electronic information sources, and also provide information retrieval training.</li>
										<li> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Reading techniques: </span> You may sometimes feel overwhelmed by exam literature or pending projects if you don’t have the right reading and study habits. Indeed, as a university student, it is probable that you need to constantly develop these skills. Reading is integral to your studies. Reading scientific texts is very different from leisure time reading. Scientific books and articles are written in a professional language specific to the field, and it is therefore important that you become well versed in the terminology and jargon of your field of study. This will allow you to thoroughly understand what is discussed.</li>
										<li> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Taking notes: </span> It is good to take notes both in class and at home while reading. Note taking clarifies your thoughts and encourages deeper thinking about the topic. You can also review your notes later. Research shows that the most successful students have a command of several note taking techniques and can switch between them depending on the situation.</li>

						<h2>Skills of a programmer</h2>
						<p>As with any other skill, a person has to study and learn programming from the ground up, and they would need to put in the time and effort that is required for them to learn. No matter how far somewhere is in his/her coding journey, chances are some rough patches will hit. Most of us struggle with motivation at one point or another when we're trying to learn any skill, and coding is a particularly difficult one, making it even harder to stay on task. To help a beginner, below are some useful skills and tips listed to learn programming:
							</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Know Why You Want To Learn Programming: </span> Different people will have different reasons for wanting to learn how to program. Whether it’s because they want to increase their net worth in today’s job market, or so they can learn a new skill that will enable them to give up their 9 – 5 job and start a potential new freelance career. Whatever the reason, knowing “why” you want to start learning programming will help you to determine the direction you want to take and how much time and energy you’ll be able to devote to your study.</li>
										<li> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Learn one programming language at a time: </span> One mistake new programmers often make is trying to learn multiple programming languages at once. Just like trying to learn Spanish and Italian at the same time, one will find that some elements of the languages will be similar to each other, but that trying to grasp them simultaneously will probably get some wires crossed.</li>
										<li> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Learn In Small Chunks: </span> Normally natural human instinct makes us wanting to speed our way to the finish line as fast as possible. When it comes to learning programming, the ironic truth is that while everyone believes that it has to take a long time to learn, and yet everyone wants to finish learning it as quickly as possible! But it is recommended that one start with basics and try to learn a small bunch of concepts at a time and do it regularly. </li>
										<li> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Don't copy-paste codes: </span> There are many information in the web which are accessible for anyone. It is really attracting to copy-paste some ready templates and work on that. While these are helpful for an advanced programmer when he/she is writing tons of codes but for a begginer it is really important that he tries to code from the scratch by his own. This practice is very important as it gives solid understanding about common coding practices and also the learning gets smoother.</li>
										<li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Teach others if possible: </span> When you learn some concepts and then teach/share those with your others, statistics shows that those learnings are more solid than others. And I have experienced the same while I was learning something and sharing those with someone else while they were fresh on my mind that the idea gets stuck in my head than other times. This happens because when you make someone else understand something you have to have good understanding first, which means it helps learning.</li>
