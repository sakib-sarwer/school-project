			<h3> Me with Programming (Relationship status): In a complicated relationship</h3>
			<p id="me_programming"> Before joining this program I have not gone through much of the programming stuff, so this whole topic was kind of new to me. Having said that, I have gone through some ICT related subjects during my high-school studies so I had ideas about flow chart and program structures, this made me confident that I can get related to programming. When I started <em>Introduction to software engineering</em> course and got acquainted with javascript, I just felt love at first sight.<br /><img class="image" src="images/js.jpg" height="250" width="350" alt="js_love"> <br /> So, I approached it with full intentions and found itself to be very interesting to get along with. It all started very well. I enjoyed first couple of lectures and excercises, apart from one or two excercises which were bit difficult for me. I had some realization that I should spend more time on this topic. But, having a busy schedule it was very hard for me to find enough time to spend. <br /> <img class="image" src="images/stress.png" height="250" width="350" alt="busy Programmer"> <br /> It has been about 3 months now, since we have been together, though it has not been going smoothly but getting better as time progresses. I am having better understanding how to deal with it and also shaping my schedule so that I can spend enough time with it.
